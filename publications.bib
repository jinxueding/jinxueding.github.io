	abstract = {Demand for high-performance electromagnetic (EM) wave absorbing materials with high-temperature resistance is always urgent for application in a harsh environment. In this contribution, two-dimensional material, Ti3C2Tx MXene, was introduced into a hyperbranched polyborosilazane. After pyrolyzation, the as-prepared TiC/SiBCN ceramics present excellent EM wave absorption in X-band. The TiC nanograins appearing after annealing provide multilevel reflection and interface polarization. Dipole polarization formed at interface defects, in company with interfacial polarization, also makes a great contribution to enhanced EM wave absorption. The TiC/SiBCN nanocomplex prepared with 5 wt\% Ti3C2Tx MXene possesses a minimum reflection coefficient of −45.44 dB at 10.93 GHz and abroad bandwidth 8.4 and 12.4 GHz, almost covering the entire X-band. Tuning the thickness in the range of 2.35-2.54 mm, the effective absorption band can achieve the entire X-band. And the EM wave absorbing performance has been maintained to a large extent at 600°C with the minimum reflection coefficient of −26.12 dB at 12.13 GHz and the effective absorption bandwidth of 2 GHz. Last but not the least, TiC/SiBCN ceramics offer a good thermal stability in argon as well as in air atmosphere, making it possible to serve in high-temperature detrimental environments. This study is expected to provide a new perspective for the design of high-performance absorbing materials that are able to be used in harsh environments, especially in high temperatures.},

Herein, we pre­ pared FexTiS2–δ with x varying from 0 to 0.05 through a two-step process, involving initial synthesis in sealed tubes followed by spark plasma sintering. Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy indicated that Fe atoms occupy the octahedral sites in the van der Waals gaps and exist in the form of Fe2+ with a high spin state. FexTiS2–δ with x ≤ 0.02 exhibit high in-plane power factors, reaching an average of {\textasciitilde} 1.2 mWm–1K–2. The structural disorder caused by Fe intercalation leads to a significant decrease in out-of-plane lattice thermal conductivity. The anisotropy in the figure of merit, ZT, of FexTiS2–δ is suppressed due to Fe intercalation. Fe0.01TiS2–δ possesses the highest ZT of 0.39 at 625 K along the in-plane direction.},

	abstract = {Transition metal sulfides have emerged as highly promising materials in thermoelectrics owing to their economic viability and sustainable characteristics. Herein, we developed entropy-engineered sulfides based on TiS2. The process of equal doping at Ti sites resulted in a notable reduction in lattice thermal conductivity due to point defects and phase segregation induced by entropy engineering; however, it also had a substantial detrimental effect on the Seebeck coefficient. Finally, by incorporating minor doping at Ti sites with Zr, Nb and Ta, each at a concentration of 1 at\%, an impressive figure of merit of 0.38 was achieved at 625 K because minor doping was able to maintain the large Seebeck coefficient while simultaneously reducing the lattice thermal conductivity. This study not only illuminates the significant role of entropy engineering in reducing lattice thermal conduc­ tivity but also sparks interest in the potential of equivalent doping at sulfur sites for future investigations.},

	abstract = {In this work, bulk Zr3Al3C5-based ceramics were synthesized by the infiltration of Al–Si melt into zirconium carbide (ZrC) perform. The phase composition, microstructure, and mechanical properties of as-fabricated ceramics were studied. The results demonstrate that Si is more effective to reduce the twin boundary energy of ZrC than Al, and thus promotes the decrease of formation temperature of Zr3Al3C5. With the infiltration temperatures increasing from 1200 to 1500 ℃, the Zr3Al3C5 content increases from 10 to 49 vol\%, which is contributed to the increase of flexural strength from 62±9 to 222±10 MPa, and fracture toughness (KIC) from 2.8±0.2 to 4.1±0.3 MPa·m1/2. The decrease of mechanical properties for the samples fabricated at 1600 ℃ is ascribed to the abnormal growth of Zr3Al3C5 grains.},

In the present work, solid solution compounds with the nominal composition Ca0.8Eu0.2Ti1–xNbxO3–δ (x = 0.05, 0.08, 0.1, 0.12) were synthesized and sintered in different atmospheres, including argon (Ar) and forming gas (5 vol\% H2 in Ar). Notably, the different reduction effects of these atmospheres resulted in significant differences in phase formation, grain size, oxygen deficiency, and TE properties of the synthesized samples. Introducing additional electrons to the system by donor substitution of Ti with Nb leads to significant changes in the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient. The most favorable TE performance of the prepared samples was found in the sample with x = 0.05, primarily attributed to its proper charge carrier concentration. This work highlights the crucial role of the sintering atmosphere in manipulating the TE performance of n-type CaTiO3-based ceramics, an effect similar to donor doping.},

The phase compositions of the prepared samples were determined through powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and their morphologies were characterized via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our investigation of the thermoelectric properties reveals that the substitution of La3+ ions significantly enhances electrical conductivity and simultaneously introducing defects that substantially reduce lattice thermal conductivity. We achieved a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of approxi­ mately 0.27 at about 1200 K for the sample with a nominal composition of Ca0.8La0.2TiO3. This study is intended as a reference to experimentalists working in MSS for synthesizing CaTiO3-based ceramics and discloses the transport properties of La-doped CaTiO3-based ceramics.},
