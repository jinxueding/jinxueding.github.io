abstract: Layered TiS2 is of great potential in thermoelectrics for room temperature
  and medium temperature applications due to its tunable transport properties, low
  environmental impact, low cost, and lightweight. Herein, we pre­ pared FexTiS2–δ
  with x varying from 0 to 0.05 through a two-step process, involving initial synthesis
  in sealed tubes followed by spark plasma sintering. Mo¨ssbauer spectroscopy indicated
  that Fe atoms occupy the octahedral sites in the van der Waals gaps and exist in
  the form of Fe2+ with a high spin state. FexTiS2–δ with x ≤ 0.02 exhibit high in-plane
  power factors, reaching an average of ~ 1.2 mWm–1K–2. The structural disorder caused
  by Fe intercalation leads to a significant decrease in out-of-plane lattice thermal
  conductivity. The anisotropy in the figure of merit, ZT, of FexTiS2–δ is suppressed
  due to Fe intercalation. Fe0.01TiS2–δ possesses the highest ZT of 0.39 at 625 K
  along the in-plane direction.
