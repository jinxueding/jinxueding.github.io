abstract: Benefiting from molten salts as reaction media, molten salt synthesis (MSS)
  offers advantages such as control of local reaction conditions to tailor material
  characteristics, the production of uniform and homogeneous crys­ tallites, as well
  as reduced energy consumption and emissions. In this study, we successfully synthesized
  regular polyhedral La-substituted CaTiO3 with an orthorhombic perovskite structure
  under molten salt conditions, uti­ lizing a NaCl–KCl eutectic mixture at 1073 K
  for 6 h. The phase compositions of the prepared samples were determined through
  powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and their morphologies were characterized via scanning
  electron microscopy (SEM). Our investigation of the thermoelectric properties reveals
  that the substitution of La3+ ions significantly enhances electrical conductivity
  and simultaneously introducing defects that substantially reduce lattice thermal
  conductivity. We achieved a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of approxi­
  mately 0.27 at about 1200 K for the sample with a nominal composition of Ca0.8La0.2TiO3.
  This study is intended as a reference to experimentalists working in MSS for synthesizing
  CaTiO3-based ceramics and discloses the transport properties of La-doped CaTiO3-based
  ceramics.
