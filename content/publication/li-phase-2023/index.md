abstract: Single-source-precursor derived ceramics exhibit advantages for the preparation
  of Si-based ceramics with controllable phase composition and adjustable functional/mechanical
  properties, which has significant potential for (ultra)high temperature ceramic
  materials. Within the present work, a series of hafnium/boron-containing Si3N4-based
  ceramics (SiHfBCN) are prepared upon pyrolysis/annealing of the corresponding single-sourceprecursors
  in N2 atmosphere at different temperatures ranging from 1000 ◦C to 1700 ◦C. The
  hightemperature (micro)structural evolution with respect to the annealing temperatures
  and boron concentration was studied using X-ray powder diffraction, Raman spectroscopy,
  and transmission electron microscopy. The results show that the amorphous SiHfBCN
  ceramics convert upon crystallization into ceramic nanocomposites consisting of
  a α-Si3N4 matrix with embedded Si, HfB2, and HfBxCyN1–x–y. The formation and stability
  of HfBxCyN1–x–y solid solution were discussed in detail. Finally, the oxidation
  resistance of the obtained α-Si3N4/ HfB2/HfBxCyN1–x–y ceramic nanocomposites was
  investigated by thermal gravimetric analysis in air.
